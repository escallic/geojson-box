This project was heavily influenced by [geojsplit](https://github.com/woodb/geojsplit) as it contains many of the same functional components in terms of asynchronous file loading and parsing of the GeoJSON format in Node.js.

This project was inspired by the OpenStreetMap community and Users' Diaries who made me aware of the data resources and building footprints available online.
