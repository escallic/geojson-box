# geojson-box
Collect GeoJSON features that lie inside a boundary coordinate box

This Node command takes a file with a geographically dispersed feature collection as its input. Of those features, it filters out the ones contained by the square neighborhood near the coordinate specified. Large database files [like these ones from Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints) won't load in certain GIS applications like [iD](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD), but they can be made smaller in size by omitting features from the invisible portion of its window.

Example:
$ `./geojson-box --latitude 34.43914 --longitude -119.90258 --precision 0.01 -o out1.geojson -i California.geojson`

In OSM, the smaller buildings file can be uploaded and rendered as a GPS trace.

# Credits
This project was heavily influenced by [geojsplit](https://github.com/woodb/geojsplit) as it contains many of the same functional components in terms of asynchronous file loading and parsing of the GeoJSON format in Node.js.

This project was inspired by the OpenStreetMap community and Users' Diaries who made me aware of the data resources and building footprints available online.
